# Objective

I was tasked to create a Java project that will allow me to demonstrate my understanding of classes and objects, inheritance and polymorphism, and exception handling. 

# About my project 

This project is a simple console-based bank application written in Java. Its purpose is to offer users basic functionalities related to bank accounts, including checking account balances, depositing money, withdrawing funds, and exiting the application.

# Key features and Functionalities 

- **Check Balance**: Users can view the current balance in their bank account.
- **Deposit**: Users can enter an amount to deposit into their bank account. This amount will be added to the current balance.
- **Withdraw**: Users can enter an amount to withdraw from their bank account. This amount will be subtracted from the balance, provided there are sufficient funds.
- **Exit**: Users can exit the application, effectively ending the program.

# How the Program Works
**User Interaction**: A menu interface is displayed in the console, allowing the user to select options by entering numbers corresponding to each action (e.g., 1 for "Check Balance").
**Input and Choice Handling**: The program uses a Scanner object to read the user’s input and a switch statement to handle the different actions based on the user’s choice.
**Looping**: A do-while loop ensures the menu keeps reappearing after each action, allowing the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit by selecting option 4.
